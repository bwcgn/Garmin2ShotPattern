# Garmin Folder

This folder should contain the exports from your Garmin device in CSV format.

You can export your shot data from the Garmin Golf app by following these steps:

1. Open the Garmin Golf app on your mobile device.
2. Navigate to the "Rounds" section and select Driving Range session you want to export.
3. Select the export option on the top right with the three dots.
4. Choose "Export as CSV" and save the file to your device.
5. Copy the exported CSV files into this `data/garmin/` folder for processing.

Now you can run the Garmin2ShotPattern application to transform the data into ShotPattern format.

Good Game! ⛳️
