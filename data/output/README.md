# Output Folder

This folder contains the transformed CSV files exported from Garmin2ShotPattern.

Files are automatically generated with timestamps and saved here when you export data.

Use the files as follows:

1. Open your ShootPattern mobile app.
2. Go to settings, and select "Upload Launch Monitor Data".
3. **IMPORTANT** - First select the unit system (meters or yards) that matches the data in the CSV!
4. Choose the CSV file from this `data/output/` folder to import your shot data
